# Cookied Wordpresses

Although supposedly going extinct, [third party cookies](../browsing/Cookies.md) are still in use by, for example, many Wordpress (feature adding) plugins. Wordpress covers around 30% of the websites on the internet.

Make the site GDPR compliant with, for example for Wordpress, plugins like [Complianz â€“ GDPR/CCPA Cookie Consent](https://wordpress.org/plugins/complianz-gdpr/) or [WordPress compliance with GDPR/ePR and CCPA](https://www.cookiebot.com/en/wordpress-cookie-plugin/). Both give a list of all third-party cookies, including the hidden ones, being transmitted by the site to visitors.
