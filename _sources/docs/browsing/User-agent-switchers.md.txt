# User-agent switchers

You can add your own user-agents, and even mimic being a webspider and switch between them. For a list of convincing user-agents see this [searchable database](http://www.user-agents.org/index.shtml) of user-agents as used by browsers, search-engines spiders and crawlers, web-directories, download managers, link checkers, proxy servers, web filtering tools, harvesters, spambots, and badbots. 

Because [LibreWolf and Brave browser](alternatives.md) are resp. based on Firefox and Chrome, these may also work in those (still have to try that).

Reuseful user-agent switcher plugins exist to make life easier (not available for all versions though): 

* [Chromium user agent switcher](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-for-c/djflhoibgkdhkhhcedjiklpkjnoahfmg) 
* [Firefox user agent string switcher](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-string-switcher)
