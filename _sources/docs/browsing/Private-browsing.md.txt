# Private browsing

Privacy mode or "private browsing" or "incognito mode" is a privacy feature in some web browsers to disable browsing history and the web cache. This allows for browsing the internet without storing local data that could be retrieved at a later date, as in, **not saving** a history of the pages visited on the Internet. 

  * Private browsing in Chrome is called Incognito. To open an Incognito window in Chrome, click Settings. From the drop-down menu, click New Incognito Window.
  * For a Private Browsing window in Firefox, click Settings. From the drop-down menu, select New Private Window.
  * Turn Private Browsing on or off on an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch by opening Safari and tapping Settings, Private, and then Done.
