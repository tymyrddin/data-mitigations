# Installing and using Wire

Find more information at [wire.com](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-desktop). Works on all platforms, uh, except that for linux, eh, [github](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-desktop) ... and the [troubleshooting page](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-desktop/wiki/Troubleshooting). Still, went without a *serious* hitch.
