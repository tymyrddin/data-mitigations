# File encryption 

Filesystem level encryption, often called file/folder encryption or //stacked level encryption//, is a form of disk encryption where individual files or directories are encrypted by the file system itself. This is in contrast to full disk or block level device encryption where an entire partition or disk, in which the file system resides, is encrypted.

## EncFS

[EncFS](https://vgough.github.io/encfs/) provides an encrypted filesystem in user-space. It runs without any special permissions and uses the FUSE library and Linux kernel module to provide the filesystem interface. EncFS is open source software, licensed under the GPL.

## eCryptfs

[eCryptfs](http://ecryptfs.org/) stores cryptographic meta data in the header of each file written, so that encrypted files can be copied between hosts; the file will be decrypted with the proper key in the Linux kernel keyring. The eCryptfs kernel module is available in all Linux kernels since 2006. The eCryptfs user space utilities (`ecryptfs-utils`) are available in all major Linux distributions.
