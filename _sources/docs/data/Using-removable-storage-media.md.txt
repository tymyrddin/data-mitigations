# Using removable storage media 

A simple but straightforward security method is to keep all sensitive information on removable storage media like portable flash memory drives or external hard drives that you only mount the device when you need access to the data on it.

You can turn old harddrives into external harddrives by taking them out of an old PC and putting them in a portable HDD USB storage kit (alias harddrive enclosure). These “DIY” kits are available for 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch HDD using either IDE or SATA connections and cost way less than a manufactured USB HDD.
