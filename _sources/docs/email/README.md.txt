# Email

Invented by Ray Tomlinson, email first entered limited use in the 1960s and by the mid-1970s had taken the form now recognized as email. It evolved, and so did its parasites:

* Email "spam". A number of effective anti-spam techniques now largely mitigate the impact of spam by filtering or rejecting it for most users, but the volume sent is still very high, and increasingly consists not of advertisements, but malicious content or links.
* Phishing emails continue to be one of the most common initial attack vectors employed by attackers for malware delivery. Attacking the human element continues to be extremely effective. To infect a system, the attacker simply has to persuade a user to click on a link or open an attachment. 
* Email spam and phishing methods typically use spoofing to mislead the recipient about the true message origin.
* Laws in many countries either allow or have loopholes in an existing law that allow the government to access stored emails without a warrant, and intelligence agencies can do and actually do so.
* Internet as well as intranet email may travel and be stored on networks and computers without the sender or the recipient having any control. During the transit time it is possible that third parties read or even modify the content. 
* The ease and impersonality of email communications mean that the social norms that encourage civility do not exist and may be forgotten. Flaming, bullying, ...

Some general guidelines to stay sane:

* Pay attention to the email address of a sender. It may imitate a legitimate sender. With only few characters altered or omitted, cybercriminals will often use an email address that closely resembles one from a reputable source.
* Hover your cursor over any links in the body of an email. Links not matching the text that appears raise a red flag. So does the use of URL shortening services. Email clients can be viewed in simple text instead of html, so one never forgets to do this. 
* Poor grammar and sentence structure, misspellings, and inconsistent formatting can be other indicators of a possible phishing attempt.
* An unsolicited email requesting a user download and open an attachment is a common delivery mechanism for malware. With a false sense of urgency or importance to help persuade a user to download or open an attachment without examining it first, completes this picture. Do not.
* Do not use public computers to access email with sensitive information.
* Virtual Private Networks or the Tor anonymity network can be used to encrypt traffic from the user machine to a safer network.
* Use a privacy-focused email host like [riseup.net](https://riseup.net/) (make sure not to use your own name or other personal information)
* GPG, PGP, SMEmail, can be used for end-to-end message encryption.
* Secure Sockets Layer can be used to encrypt communications for a single mail hop between the SMTP client and the SMTP server.
