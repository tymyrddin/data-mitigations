# Anonymising email

The simplest way to anonymously send email is to 

* Use a new webmail account without revealing any personal information (an account where one doesn't have to enter a phone number for), like for instance [Guerrilla Mail](https://www.guerrillamail.com/). 
* Use a webmail service in the [Tor Browser](../traffic/Tor.md) or over a [VPN](../traffic/VPN.md) or other [secure tunnel](../traffic/Tunnelling.md)
* [Torbirdy](https://wiki.debian.org/TorBirdy) configures Thunderbird clients to make connections over Tor.
