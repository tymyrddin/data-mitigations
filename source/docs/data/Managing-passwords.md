# Managing passwords

Passwords were the first mechanisms used for authenticating users on timeshared computer systems, and despite years of effort (or at least years of complaining about them) are still the near universal method of authentication on PC's and the internet.

* Use passwords with at least 8 characters, if possible more. Include numbers, symbols, and punctuation if allowed. 
* Do not use dictionary words, concatenations of dictionary words, repeated sequences of characters, or personal information in passwords.
* Use different passwords for different accounts or roles.
* Test passwords in a secure password tool.
* Do not store passwords on laptops, smartphones or tablets that can be lost. Store on an USB stick.
* Use two-factor authentication when available.
* Use a secure password generator.
* Use a password manager.

## Choosing a password manager

Using a password manager allows you to load passwords in your clipboard, making it hard to catch it with a keylogger (just in case). And all good password managers allow you to generate passwords, making the passwords independent from each other and your personal preferences and much harder to crack.
